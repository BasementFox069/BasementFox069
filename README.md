### Hi there 👋

<!--
**BasementFox069/BasementFox069** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭Hey there, it's Prithviraj, you can call me Skyler or Sky for that matter, currently chilling in London! I have had a good bit of experience working as a Data Analyst, and I've gotten my hands dirty with a bunch of cool tools like Data Visualization, Python, Pandas, Power BI, Java, MySQL,Tableau(public) and Machine Learning.
- 🌱 I'm all about exploring new tech, and I'm especially interested in Artificial Intelligence, Natural language Processing, Data Mining, Cloud Databases. Basically, anything that involves data and makes life more interesting!
- 🏫 Recently graduated with Masters in Big Data Science and Machine Learning at Queen Mary University, London. It's been a wild ride so far, and I'm excited to see where it takes me next.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data analyst projects that allow me to dig into data and uncover insights. I'm comfortable with various programming languages and tools for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. I'm passionate about using data to make informed decisions and would love to work with others who share that passion. Let's team up and make a data-driven impact!
- 😄 Pronouns: Honestly, I'm not picky - just don't call me late to happy hour! 😉
- ⚡ Fun fact: Fun fact: Did you know that data is the new oil? It's a valuable resource that can be refined and leveraged to power businesses and industries. And just like oil, data needs to be extracted, cleaned, and refined to be useful. So let's roll up our sleeves and get to work!
